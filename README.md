# Vintage Band Name Bot

A Twitter bot that generates names of the kind of dance bands seen on 78RPM records. Tweets hourly at [@78_bands](https://twitter.com/78_bands). In the `web` directory there's a React app version that you can click on to your heart's content. To build it, run `npm install` in the root directory, then `npm run build`.

The file `bnf.txt` contains a BNF grammar for the band name structure. I wrote it before starting the code, so the output is more complex now.
