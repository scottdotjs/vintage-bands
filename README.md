# Vintage Band Name Bot

A Twitter bot to generate names of the kind of dance bands that you see on 78RPM records. Tweets hourly at [@78_bands](https://twitter.com/78_bands). In the `web` directory there's a web page version; to recompile it, do `npm run dev` in the root directory. The file `bnf.txt` contains a BNF grammar for band name structure before creating the code; the output is better than that now, but it can give you an idea of what's going on.
